    <p>Object oriented languages allow for the creation of objects using something that behaves like a blueprint for a house. In Ruby this blueprint is called a class and in JavaScript this blueprint is called a constructor. Both languages allow you to create a new object from this blueprint that will have certain kinds of properties and abilities, but the way you do it is slightly different. Here's how to create a class in Ruby:</p>
    <code>class Home<br/>
      <br/>
      def initialize(rooms, garage)<br/>
      @rooms = rooms<br/>
      @garage = garage<br/>
      end<br/>
      <br/>
      def newaddition(newroom)<br/>
      @rooms += newroom<br/>
      end<br/>
      <br/>
      end<br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>           
      new_home = Home.new(5,True)<br/>
      new_home.newaddition(2)
    </code>
    <p>We're telling Ruby which two things will be required to build a new home. Next we're providing a way to make an addition to an existing home. Then we actually create a new home with 5 bedrooms and a garage. Finally we decide to do an addition to the new home so we add 2 bedrooms. Here's how to create a constructor for the same type of object in JavaScript:</p>
    <code>function Home(rooms, garage) {</br>
      <br/>
      this.rooms: rooms,</br>
      this.garage: garage,</br>
      <br/>
      this.newAddition = function(newroom) {<br/>
      this.rooms += newroom;<br/>
      },<br/>
      <br/>
      }<br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>           
      newHome = new Home(5,True)<br/>
      newHome.newAddition(2)<br/>
    </code>
    <p>There is no explicit constructor object in JavaScript so we can't leverage that to build our blueprint. Instead we use a function to <em>serve as</em> our constructor. Ruby has classes to handle the blueprint, but Javascript does not. After the definition of our blueprint, the two languages behave similarly in that we can specify what is required to create a new object and store those properties at the time of creation.</p>
    <p>Both languages provide a way to modify the object. In Ruby we can define a method and in JavaScript we can nest a function. Both languages handle the new addition in the same way as you can see from our addition of 2 rooms to the home. As you can see the languages are similar when it comes to creating objects, albeit with some sytanx differences!</p>
