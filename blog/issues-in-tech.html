  <h2>Privacy vs Security</h2>
  <h4>1/23/2016</h4>
  <section>
    <p>There is an ongoing debate in the United States and elsewhere over the right to privacy for the individual vs security for all.</p>

    <p>In the Unites States, the 4th ammendment gives us the right to be secure from warantless search and seizure. However, given recent disclosures by whistleblowers and journalists the US government does not seem to consistently apply this right to online activity and newer forms of communication. Big parts of our lives have become digital and so it would seem logical to extend 4th ammendment rights to our activities there.</p>

    <p>Many technology companies were put in an embarassing situation when the extent of their relationships with US government security agencies were exposed. When we visit their websites, add information to our social media profiles, and send messages to friends we're implicitly trusting them to keep that communication private or at least tell us how it will be shared. Many companies were sharing this information with US government security agencies in bulk fashion without informing us, which was both a suprise and cause for alarm.</p>

    <p>Since technology companies need us to trust them in order to exist, they have become more sensitive to the individuals' desire for privacy. One of the ways they are facilitating privacy is by handing the "keys" over to the individual instead of maintaing them on our behalf. This means that the individual has control over who receives access to their data and that it's impossible for the companies to fully comply with US government security agency requests for access. (This is done through the use of encryption and public/private keys, a topic for another time!)</p>

    <p>This creates a situation where the technology company that made the software can't comply with requests for data and only the individual can be compelled to do so. This level of privacy may seem like a great thing, however if there is a legitimate security threat posed by an individual then a timely investigation may be impossible. Without the technology company to provide access, the US government security agencies are left with two options: Request access from the individual or work to subvert the encryption method. (Check out the heartbleed bug and quantum computing, again future topics!)</p>

    <p>There are many legitimate reasons for US government security agencies to have access to data about us, namely enforcing our laws and protecting us against threats to our safety. All activities are becoming digital, not just the ones we think of as being a positive thing. There needs to be a better way to balance privacy for the individual with security for all. </p>

    <p>I would propose a digital protocol for serving and responding to warrants. The goal would be to make legitimate security investigation possible, while also making the individual aware of which data will be accessed and how long it will be kept. Since timeliness is important, there would need to be a mechanism to allow for immediate access with notification provided at a subsequent date. I'm sure this approach is wrought with challenges, but the concept is one that I think is worth exploring.</p>
