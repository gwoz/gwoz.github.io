    <p>Building this site has been a fun challenge for me. I've used HTML and CSS before, but I wanted to push myself to try new things and get to a more professional look in the process.</p>

    <p>I designed the site drawing on programming and financial styling elements with the black background and bright text. To be honest design and especially color selection isn't really my strong point so I'm proud of what I was able to produce. I learned first hand just how important it is to get the wireframes right before getting into the code. A couple times I had to do rework when "brilliant" ideas struck later on in the process. Never again! :)</p>

    <p>The site was built using the new semantic elements available in HTML5 instead of resorting to div's, id's, and classes. This was much more intuitive than I thought it would be and made the CSS much easier to manage along with making the code easier to read.</p>

    <p>I learned a lot about CSS3 and tried to incorporate some of the newer pseudo-elements. At times I thought it might make more sense to reserve this interactivity for JavaScript, but with a basic site I can really see the value in keeping it simple.</p>

    <p>For smaller projects I would probably start from a front-end framework like Bootstrap to reduce the amount of work needed to make the site responsive. I would also plan the build using tools available in GitHub so I don't miss anything and keep to a schedule. The milestones and labels on GitHub are great for making sure the changes needed get done and seem to offer similar utility as Trello. Thanks for reading!</p>
