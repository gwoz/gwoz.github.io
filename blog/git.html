        Version control is used to track changes to a project over time. This is used by designers, technical documentation writers, and especially by software developers. Git is a version control software application that is installed on your local computer. GitHub is the cloud-based repository that allows for collaboration with people all around the world.

    <p>
        Git helps you keep track of changes to your project by saving file additions, modifications, and deletions in commits. Commits are snapshots in time of the files you are working on. It would be great if you could store all of your snapshots in a central place for safekeeping or to make them available to other people for collaboration. That's where GitHub comes in. When using GitHub, you can "push" your commits out to a central place for review first. If everything looks good your changes can be "pulled" into the master version of the project. The entire project and it's previous versions can then be accessed by others.
    </p>
    <p>
        Without GitHub you would need to manually send files back and forth to collaborate on a project. Some people would be working from older versions of the project which would cause issues with what others are doing on newer versions of the project when they are integrated together. When using GitHub you know which version you are working on and which one everyone else is working on. When you are ready to contribute, your changes can first be reviewed before being integrated into the overall project. Issues are minimized and progress is accelerated.
