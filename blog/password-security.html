  <h2>Password Security</h2>
  <h3>Why they should be longer and always unique</h3>

  <section id="post">
    <p>The number of accounts we manage has grown significantly in recent years. However, our ability to remember log-in credentials is becoming an issue. Many people still use short passwords that are easy to remember or passwords they've used before. We all know a password should be hard to "crack", but what does that really mean and how do we go about doing this?</p>

    <p>At a minimum we want our passwords to be long. We're not only trying to make it difficult for an eavesdropping friend or neighbor to crack. We're trying to make it difficult for a computer that would be attempting millions of characters until it finds the correct permutation. This is the basic concept of a "brute force" attack. It can take the form of password cracking software on a personal computer or a more sophisticed attacker harnessing the computing power of several computers. Check out the nefarious Metulji/Mariposa botnet which is rumored to have used over 10 million computers for several purposes; password cracking being one of them!</p>

    <p>With millions of guesses per second it would only take a few minutes to cycle through every possible permutation of characters for a password that is 5 characters long. It does not matter if you're using special characters, capital letters, numbers, letters. There are a relatively limited number of possibilities for a computer to try. You want to aim for passwords that are 12 - 14 characters long at minimum and even longer if possible.</p>

    <p>So 12 - 14 characters sounds like a lot, how can we make one this long without forgetting it? Many experts recommend stringing together 4 unrelated words that do not form a sentence or include any personal information. We don't want to form a sentence because anything with a pattern is easy for a computer to prioritize when guessing. We also don't want to use any personal information because it could be available online somewhere for a computer to prioritize when geuessing. Compare "springradioelevatorflip" to "Frank88!". You have four things to remember in the first one and four things (Capitalized first letter, name, birthday year, exclamation point) to remember in the second, but the first is much more secure because of the length.</p>

    <p>Even if we have a strong password, we don't want to re-use the same one. Since email addresses are easy for us to remember, many companies make this our personal identifier when logging in. Our email addreses are made available everywhere so you should assume it's not a secret to anyone or anything (Looking at you botnet!). If just one password is cracked, then your other accounts could be compromised as well. Again, this isn't just a person trying to use your log in a few times, but a computer checking hundreds of sites to see which ones work and then collecting as much of your information as possible.</p>

    <p>So how can you get the best of long passwords without having to remember all of them? Enter password managers. Password managers are gaining popularity because they enable you to create one really strong password which serves as a gateway to all of your other passwords. The risk of relying on one password is mitigated through use of multi-factor authentication. The idea is to combine that password that only you should know with a second check (Physical token, text message, etc) to make sure it's actually you logging in. Even though nothing is perfect, this just might be the most practical solution available today.</p>

    <p>I highly recommend checking out this password checker to see how long one might take to be cracked. Just don't use any of your real passwords!</p>
