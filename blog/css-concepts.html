<!-- Using your budding research skills, explore the answers to one of the following questions:

What is the difference between margin, border, and padding?
What are the best practices associated with using classes vs. ids?
What are the differences between relative, absolute, fixed, and static positioning?
What does it mean to display inline vs using inline block?
Release 2: Blog!

Write a blog post that teaches others the answer to one of these questions and how and when to use each. There is no length requirement, but it should show off the knowledge you gained this week. Include examples of code and screen shots to help teach others!

HINT: Intend your blog for a non-technical audience, since this will help you determine whether you fully understand the concept yourself. Imagine explaining the concept to a non-technical friend, step by step.

Release 3: Publish

Now is the time to add your post link to your blog/index.html file. You may need to link the post from Week 1 as well. 

Go through your git workflow to create a pull request and merge it to the master branch! -->
