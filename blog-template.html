How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
Ans: I found this part difficult. We both already had an idea for how we wanted the page to look and had to compromise a lot in the version we made together. It would have been easier to discuss requirements together first so we were on the same page for wireframing.
Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
Ans: It's very helpful. I like to keep the wireframe open on one screen and sublime on another.
What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?
Ans: We decided a good wireframe was simple instead of complex. At this point we don't have a lot of best practices for designing websites so rather than get carried away we kept it simple.
What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?
Ans: I learned about article which is a self-contained group of elements that could stand alone on their own page. This is helpful for linking and sharing and can be applied to things like news stories, blog posts, or user comments.
